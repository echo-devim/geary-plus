	<title>Delete or archive a message</title>

	<p>When you use Geary with a Gmail account, Geary lets you <em>archive</em> messages.
	The <gui>Archive</gui> toolbar button archives the selected conversation(s).
	Archived messages appear in the <gui>All Mail</gui> folder.</p>

	<p>With other mail servers, you can trash or delete, but not archive, messages.  To move
	one or more conversations to the <gui>Trash</gui> folder, select them and press the <gui>Trash</gui>
	button on the toolbar.  To permanently delete the conversations, hold down <key>Shift</key> and press
	the <gui>Delete</gui> button that appears in place of the <gui>Trash</gui> button.</p>

	<p>Delete is not available from every folder, such as Search.  Delete is also unavailable for Gmail.
	For Gmail, <gui>Trash</gui> will move messages to the Trash folder on the server, where the user can
	then manually delete them.  The server will automatically remove trashed messages after 30 days.</p>
